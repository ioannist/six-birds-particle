Michael Levin would expect evidence of:

Pattern memory / setpoints in a morphospace
A low‑dimensional description of the system’s pattern (a “shape” descriptor), which is stable and can be returned to after perturbations. Not self‑healing as a narrative, but setpoint restoration as a measurable dynamical property.

Competency curves
Not a single run/preset, but a success probability vs perturbation amplitude vs deadline picture: what “space of perturbations” the system can handle. That’s the most “Levin” thing you can measure without adding goals.

Top‑down causation as predictive/counterfactual leverage
The lifted operator substrate (K) should have measurable predictive influence on future macrostates beyond what the current macrostate predicts. In other words: K is not just correlated; it adds control information.

Costs
All of the above should be related to dissipation (your epExact and bucket splits), because your whole thesis is ratchet‑priced clocks/codes/constraints.
