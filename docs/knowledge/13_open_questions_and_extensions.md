# Open Questions and Extensions

This document lists natural extensions and research questions suggested by the current spec.

## 1) Minimal emergence of “ratchet stacking”

Given primitives P₁–P₆, investigate whether:
- enabling one primitive creates conditions that make another primitive’s effects more likely,
- producing layered organization without any external schedules.

Formally: look for regimes where enabling a subset increases the observed cycle affinities for additional motifs (Deliverable C), and increases persistence times for patterns (Deliverable D).

## 2) Communication toy worlds inside the sandbox

Implement a minimal “meaning–signal” micro-world (separate from particle physics) to explore Weakness × Economy behavior in the playground paradigm:

- implement “weakness” as saturating influence and/or bounded posterior updates,
- implement “economy” as energy cost of emitting symbols,
- avoid global objectives: let any directionality arise only from P₃/P₆.

Compare empirical mutual information growth to the theoretical bound:
\[
I \le (B/c_{\min})\,\varepsilon.
\]

## 3) Protocol geometry experiments (pure P₃)

Design protocol schedules where:
- each substep is reversible,
- but the product is nonreversible.

Use hysteresis loop area and pumped currents as diagnostics.

## 4) Quantized step barriers (P₄)

Explore barrier shaping:
- make \(\Delta E(n\to n+1)\) depend on \(n\),
- test whether reversal times scale roughly like \(\exp(\beta\Delta E)\).

## 5) Safe-set field dynamics (P₅)

Compare:
- reversible Metropolis field updates (null),
- driven build/erode updates under P₆.

Look for emergent “habitats” and their persistence.

## 6) Emergent replication (later layer)

Even though replication/heredity are not assumed at the base layer, one can ask:
- do any combinations of primitives produce structures that effectively copy themselves?
- can copying arise as a higher-level pattern (e.g., templating / polymerization analogs) once P₆ is enabled?

This should be studied as an *emergent* phenomenon, not an imposed rule.
